Open Source Dictionaries


There are no high quality open source spanish dictionaries.  
Will you help in creating one?  You can easily support this project by forking
and writing an example for a definition or adding another definition.  
A list of all words that are defined are in es/words.txt.

The actual dictionary is in es/dict.json.  The format looks like:

    {
        "definitions": [
            {
                "gender": "", 
                "part_of_speech": "", 
                "example": "", 
                "definition": "a quemarropa, bruscamente, directamente, sin rodeos"
            }
        ], 
        "word": "a bocajarro", 
        "stem": ""
    } 


Please only use definition OF YOUR OWN CREATION.  Definitions are copyright by the dictionary companies.  Using one will violate their licensing terms.  Lets keep this open and free


Right now there is ONLY the beginnings of a spanish dictionary
